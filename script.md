I was going to talk about the topic of OpenWrt. But one of my friends, Menci, who works in Microsoft China Suzhou told me that she is going to make a sharepoint about transgender. I think that maybe I should do that topic first like her so I changed the plan and going to talk about gender spectrum today.
I will talk about the following topics and that`s about the basic concepts about gender spectrum. I will use the contents made by Stanford University School of Medicine and the contents are free licensed in Coursera. I will pick up some of them because they talked about it more clear than me.
Actually, when I realized that I am a transgender, I also felt confused about some of the questions like do I have to be attracted to man as a transgirl. And later I encountered a transgirl whose name is do_not_exist. We have some talk and I got the knowledge that sexual orientation and gender identity are different independent concepts. After that, I have a connection with a transgender forum in Taiwan called blacklight town and acquired detailed knowledge around this. By the way, I define my sexual orientation as demisexual specifically fell attracted to the one who is Sophie. One more thing I would like to mention is that do_not_exist passed away duo to Hypotension caused by drug complications. We made a site called one-among.us to in memory of her.
